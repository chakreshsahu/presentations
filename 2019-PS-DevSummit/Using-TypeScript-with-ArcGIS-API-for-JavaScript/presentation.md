## Agenda

- Development tooling & setup
- Working with the 4.x JS API
- Accessor, decorators, and advanced concepts

---

<!-- .slide: data-background="../reveal.js/img/2019/devsummit/bg-4.png" -->

## Super quick TS intro

---

## Superset of JavaScript

- *Transpiles* to JavaScript
- ESNext features (import, =>, rest/spread, async/await, etc)
- Types
- Compatible with existing JavaScript

---

## Benefits of TypeScript

![TypeScript](images/typescript.jpg)
- Easier for multiple people to work on
- Easier to refactor
- Easier to test
- Can help prevent technical debt

## Development tooling

---

## Essentials

- typescript: `npm install --save-dev typescript`
- JS API 4.x typings: `npm install --save-dev @types/arcgis-js-api`
- JS API 3.x typings: `npm install --save-dev @types/arcgis-js-api@3`

---

## Recommended

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- tslint: `npm install --save-dev tslint`

---

## Setting Up

- [developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/typescript-setup](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/guide/typescript-setup/index.html)

## Working with the JavaScript API

---

## Imports

- JS API is currently strictly AMD
- Conventionally classes are exported directly
- Requires the use of `require` style imports
  - `import MapView from "esri/views/MapView"`
  - Or, use `esModuleInterop` with typescript 2.7.2

---

## Auto-cast

- Due to nature of types, auto-cast does not type-check
  - `get` and `set` must have the same type
- Auto-casting is supported in constructor signatures only
  - Still helps in lots of cases
  - For setting properties, need to import the relevant modules

---

## Typing improvements

- Use of generics where possible `Collection<T>`
- Strictly type events (`MapView.on("mouse-wheel", ...)`))
- "Advanced" auto-casts like colors (`"red"`), screen sizes (`"5px"`) and basemaps `"streets"`

## Advanced API concepts

---

## Promises

- In 4.7, promises are more compatible with native promises
- Replaced `then` with `when` for `esri/core/Promise`
- Typings are more compatible (although not fully compatible)
- General advice is to wrap API promises in native if needed
  until JS API switches to native promises

---

## Writing Accessor based classes

- Can be useful to use Accessor based classes in your app
- Also required for creating custom API based widgets
- API classes are using dojo declare, requires some additional work to integrate with TS
- [Code](./demos/subclass)

---

## Multiple inheritance

- Multiple inheritance possible with dojo declare
- Supported in typescript at runtime and strictly type-checked
- Uses declaration merging
- [Code](./demos/subclass)

---

## Extending the API typings

- API typings are not always as strict as they can be
- In rare occasions typings are missing or imprecise
- Typings can be externally "patched" through declaration merging
- [Code](./demos/type-extensions)
